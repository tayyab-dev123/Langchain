The world must be made safe for democracy....
It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and
disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more
precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest to
our hearts for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their
own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right
by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the
world itself at last free. To such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything
that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come
when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her
birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do no
other.
